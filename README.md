# Immersera

#Brief description
===
Immersera is a Layer2 blockchain protocol based on Binance Smart Chain.Immersera offers higher throughput, faster finality and more efficient dispute resolution than previous Rollups.Immersera implements these features through several design principles: separating the order of transactions from deterministic execution; separating the order of transactions from deterministic execution; 

Combining the existing BSC Layer1 network with extensions to enable cross-chain functionality; compiling separately for execution and proofs, so execution is fast and proofs are structured and machine-independent; and using the Supertrust protocol to settle transaction results to the underlying BSC chain.

Immersera is focused on building web3, Metaverse and GameFi infrastructure, providing developers and users with unlimited possibilities of block GameFi experience. 

ImmerseEra has optimized the EVM protocol layer for the product features of Web3.0, Metaverse and GameFi industry, BRC-1233, BRC-1244, BRC-1255 protocols have revolutionized the traditional game developers to GameFi, BRC-1233, BRC-1244, and BRC-1255 protocols solve the biggest problem for traditional game developers to switch to GameFi, bringing trillions of traditional games to the blockchain and revolutionizing the Web3.Metaverse industry.


#Immersera introduction
===
In previous work, we described Immersera, a system and protocol that extends the performance and scalability of smart contracts. This paper describes Immersera, a significantly improved design that provides advantages over the original, including higher efficiency, reduced latency, stronger activity guarantees, and better incentive compatibility.

#Smart contract 
===

integration of BRC-4337 protocol, development of BRC-1233, BRC-1244, BRC-1255 protocol

#Integration of BRC-4337 protocol, abstract accounts

#Social account login, players do not need to remember the helper word or private key, through the social relationship to restore the account, the game integrated BRC-4337 protocol, players can use common email, cell phone login

Social account login solves 3 problems of traditional private key wallets.

#The threshold is too high, users need to have some basic knowledge about public key and private address before they can use the wallet; 

#Assets are easily lost, users need to save their own private key, once the private key is leaked, the assets will never be recovered; 

#The efficiency is low, every transaction on the chain requires signature authorization and other steps to complete the transaction confirmation. For example, if you play web3 game, if all the games are on the chain, then you need to sign and confirm every action in the game, which will affect the game experience.

#Gas fee substitution, players do not need to buy BNB for transferring Gas fee when operating on the chain, Gas fee can be paid by the game publisher or use BRC20 tokens as Gas fee, reducing the learning cost of players

The introduction of this feature reduces the cost of use for players, making it more convenient and user-friendly, especially for players new to GameFi or those who do not hold a BNB. Players can focus on the game itself without worrying about the purchase and management of Gas fees.

#Batch packaged transactions, support multiple packaged one send, similar to the transactions on Dex, new tokens need to approve authorization before swap (swap), while account abstraction can be done in one step.

#Automatic transaction (similar to Alipay's secret-free payment), when the user sets the transaction conditions, the transaction will run automatically when the relevant conditions are met. In the game, after the requirements are met, the signature is automatically authorized to improve the game experience, and the high frequency transaction on the chain can improve the usage experience. 1.1.5 User 

Authentication and Authorization: ImmerseEra uses blockchain user authentication and authorization mechanisms to enable players to be authenticated by wallet address and to controlpermissions and access in a smart contract. This protects players' personal data and game assets, and ensures a fair and secure gaming environment.



#BRC-1233
===
#Support NFT game props to be chained with one click, using BRC-1233 protocol standard, hundreds of game NFT props in traditional games can be issued on the chain in a very simple way, traditional game developers do not even need to build smart contract development environment, no need to learn solidity development language, which greatly reduces the migration cost of traditional games to GameFi

#Support one key to convert traditional game currency such as game gold and points into blockchain tokens. After conversion into blockchain tokens, the game can develop many advanced gameplay methods according to the technical characteristics of blockchain, and transform players into shareholders and promoters, so that the income of the game is associated with individuals, which will greatly reduce the promotion cost of the game and is a big trend in the future.

In the future, the innovation of GameFi industry will surely make people feel the new production relationship of blockchain distribution for the first time, and the traditional corporate system of distribution will become history.

#BRC-1244
===
It supports one-key listing transaction of game props, using BRC-1244 protocol, game players can conveniently put the game tools and characters on the NFT trading market with one key, so that game developers do not need to develop their own game stores, reducing the development cost of the game and players gain more autonomy, and the model of game trading platforms such as 5173 will be advanced in the blockchain field.

#BRC-1255
===
The BRC-1255 protocol provides protocol-level support for prop synthesis, upgrades, and inscriptions in games, eliminating the need for developers to build complex contracts at the contract development level, and requiring only a few hours to build a BRC-1255-compliant synthesizable, upgradable NFT. Without the BRC-1255 protocol, it would take weeks to complete the same work
